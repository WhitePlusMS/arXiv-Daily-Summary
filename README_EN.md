## ‚ö° Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the project locally
git clone https://github.com/WhitePlusMS/arXiv-Daily-Summary.git

# 2. Enter project directory
cd arXiv-Daily-Summary

# 3. Recommended to use uv for dependency installation (if not installed yet)
pip install uv

# 4. Create virtual environment using uv
uv venv

# 5. Activate virtual environment (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# 6. Install project dependencies using uv (with uv environment activated)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 7. Copy environment variable configuration file
copy .env.example .env

# 8. Edit .env file and fill in your API key (Important!)
#    Please manually open .env file and fill in DASHSCOPE_API_KEY
#    You can get API key from Qwen: https://console.aliyun.com/dashscope

# 9. Start the application!
python start.py

# 10. Access Web Interface
#     Open browser and visit http://localhost:8501
#     You can configure research interests, adjust parameters, and view real-time recommendation results in the interface

# enjoy it!
```

The system will automatically handle environment configuration, dependency installation, and service startup.

### Workflow

1. **Paper Retrieval**: Fetch latest papers from arXiv API for specified categories
2. **Intelligent Filtering**: Relevance matching based on user interests
3. **AI Analysis**: Generate paper summaries and scores using Qwen models
4. **Result Display**: Show recommendation results in web interface
5. **Historical Archive**: Automatically save recommendation records to local files

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Guide

### 1. User Creation

The core of "User Creation" is to establish a precise ArXiv category profile for each user through the **Category Matcher** interface. It allows users to describe their research interests in natural language, and the system automatically matches them with official ArXiv categories, saving the most relevant categories to the user's configuration.

**Operation Process:**

1. **Access Category Matcher**: Click "Category Matcher" in the left navigation bar.
2. **Input Information**:
    - **Username**: Enter your username for unique identification and saving your matching results.
    - **Research Content Description**: Describe your research directions, interest areas, keywords, etc. in detail in the text box. For example:

        ```
        I mainly focus on using Large Language Models (LLM) for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, especially how to optimize their performance on multimodal data.
        ```

3. **Start Matching**: Click the "Start Matching" button.
4. **Automatic Matching & Saving**:
    - The system backend calls large language models to calculate semantic similarity between your natural language description and official ArXiv categories defined in `data/users/arxiv_categories.json`.
    - The system returns a category list sorted by matching scores from high to low.
    - These highest-scoring category results are automatically saved to the `data/users/user_categories.json` file, associated with your username, completing user profile creation.

**Data Management:**

The bottom of the page provides comprehensive management functions for created user data:

- **View & Search**: Browse all user matching records and search by username or research content.
- **Edit**: Modify user research content descriptions and re-match.
- **Delete**: Delete individual or batch user records.
- **Export**: Support exporting user data as JSON files.

### 2. Daily Paper Recommendation

After creating user profiles, the main interface **ArXiv Daily Paper Recommendation System** provides core paper recommendation functionality. It automatically pulls, filters, and analyzes the latest relevant papers from ArXiv based on selected user profiles.

**Operation Process:**

1. **Select User Configuration**: In the top dropdown menu, select a user you created in the "Category Matcher".
    * The system automatically loads the user's configuration, including their matched **category tags** and **research interests**.
2. **Start Recommendation**: Click the "Start Paper Recommendation" button.
3. **Monitor & View Results**:
    * After system startup, **real-time running logs** are displayed below, clearly showing each step's execution status, such as "Fetching Papers", "Analyzing Papers", "Generating Reports", etc.
    * After successful execution, recommendation results are displayed in tab format, including **Summary Content**, **Detailed Analysis**, and **Brief Analysis**.
    * Meanwhile, the system generates complete `HTML` and `Markdown` format reports that you can preview directly on the webpage or download locally.
